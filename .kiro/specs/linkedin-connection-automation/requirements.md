# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements an automated LinkedIn connection system that logs into LinkedIn, navigates to the network growth section, and selectively connects with people based on mutual connection count thresholds. The application uses Next.js for the web interface and Playwright for browser automation.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a LinkedIn user, I want to automatically log into LinkedIn using my credentials, so that I can access my network features without manual intervention.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://www.linkedin.com/home
2. WHEN on the LinkedIn home page THEN the system SHALL click the "Sign in with email" button
3. WHEN the login form appears THEN the system SHALL input username from environment variable into input with id="username"
4. WHEN username is entered THEN the system SHALL input password from environment variable into input with id="password"
5. WHEN credentials are entered THEN the system SHALL submit the login form
6. IF login fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and stop execution

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a LinkedIn user, I want to navigate to the network growth section, so that I can access potential connections.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN login is successful THEN the system SHALL navigate to https://www.linkedin.com/mynetwork/grow/
2. WHEN on the network growth page THEN the system SHALL locate and click button with data-view-name="cohort-section-see-all"
3. WHEN the button is clicked THEN the system SHALL wait for modal dialog with data-testid="dialog" to appear
4. IF the modal does not appear within timeout THEN the system SHALL log error and retry once

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a LinkedIn user, I want to automatically connect with people who have a high number of mutual connections, so that I can expand my network strategically.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the modal dialog opens THEN the system SHALL identify all cards with role="listitem"
2. WHEN processing each card THEN the system SHALL extract text from paragraph with classes containing mutual connections information
3. WHEN mutual connections text is found THEN the system SHALL parse the number of mutual connections using regex pattern "and (\d+) other mutual connections"
4. IF the mutual connections count is greater than the threshold from environment variable THEN the system SHALL click the "Connect" button in that card
5. WHEN a connection is made THEN the system SHALL log the action and increment connection counter
6. WHEN connection counter reaches maximum limit from environment variable THEN the system SHALL stop execution
7. IF no more eligible cards are found THEN the system SHALL stop execution

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want to configure the application through environment variables, so that I can control behavior without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read LINKEDIN_USERNAME from environment variables
2. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read LINKEDIN_PASSWORD from environment variables
3. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read MIN_MUTUAL_CONNECTIONS from environment variables
4. WHEN the application starts THEN the system SHALL read MAX_CONNECTIONS from environment variables with default value of 100
5. IF any required environment variable is missing THEN the system SHALL log error and exit

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a user, I want to monitor the automation process through logs and a web interface, so that I can track progress and troubleshoot issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any action is performed THEN the system SHALL log the action with timestamp
2. WHEN connections are made THEN the system SHALL display current count and remaining connections
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log detailed error information
4. WHEN the process completes THEN the system SHALL display summary of connections made
5. WHEN the web interface is accessed THEN the system SHALL show current status and allow starting/stopping automation
